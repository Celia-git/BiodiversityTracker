Python program uses SQL queries to gather data and matplot to display multi-bar graphs of observations of each species type at various National Parks.  Two database files, observations and species_info, are queried through a root server on the localhost.  Root server with schema "species" and database tables "observations" and "species_info" must be established on the local host to test the program.
